# To-Do-program
A To-do program web application made with flask. It allows you to add,edit, and delete tasks and set the time they should be completed by.

warning: you will need to add "/due_date", or "/category" to the web address to display the page.

I wanted the look to be simple, elegant and intuitive. I tried making the form to add new tasks horizontal (so that it matched the task entries), but could not manage to get it to work. Overall, I am pleased with how it looks.

![todo-3](https://github.com/HarryPilgrim/To-Do-program/assets/76102114/f899b76c-d5f9-4ab7-90a0-a6147903868e)

You enter your task into the form, and the date. you can use a pre-existing category, or add a new category, upon which you will be redirected to create that category. (this is one of the places where I think using Javascript would be better to make it add a new category responsively).

![todo-4](https://github.com/HarryPilgrim/To-Do-program/assets/76102114/bc5a2f29-2901-4ee8-a88f-dd03d572f666)

You can edit the task information, but again, this is something that I would like to improve upon.

![todo-5](https://github.com/HarryPilgrim/To-Do-program/assets/76102114/b823d513-2cb0-4d24-8c13-8fe49c358278)

I would also like to add a system where you can subscribe to recieve emails about your upcoming tasks, or to connect to your calender.



# What I learnt

I tried to do some quite complicated things initially (pagination, dynamic drop-down menus, horizontal and attractive form etc.) and I found myself struggling to make these things, and running into a lot of problems. It gave me an understanding of why programming projects are always sliced up into smaller, managable sections. I realised I should make a basic app first, and then once you have a minimum viable product, then you can start to try new things, always having the working product to fall back on.
