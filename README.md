# To-Do-program
A To-do program made in flask for use as a website. It allows you to add,edit, and delete tasks and set the time they should be completed by.




# What I learnt

I tried to do some quite complicated things initially (pagination, dynamic drop-down menus, horizontal and attractive form etc.) and I found myself struggling to make these things, and running into a lot of problems. It gave me an understanding of why programming projects are always sliced up into smaller, managable sections. I realised I should make a basic app first, and then once you have a minimum viable product, then you can start to try new things, always having the working product to fall back on.
